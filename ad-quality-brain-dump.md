# Brain Dump - Feature Ideas
So i want the AI to generate quality strong strength campaigns. Users, when they sign up and complete onboarding, they have a 3 day free trial, after that, they cannot regenerate, connect to google ads and push campaigns, these buttons become disabled until they pay, so the user clicks on upgrade plan which leads them to pay. Also, when the user pays, when they go to the landing page and go to the pricing section, it should say which plan they are on. The user can only regenerate a campaign 3 times a month - this can be by either clicking on the regenerate campaign button or by editing the information in the settings page which produces a campaign based on the information given - so that will count as a regeneration. Once the regeneration count finishes, the regeneration button gets disabled and they cannot edit the information in the settings page (because editing triggers regeneration). But they can still view everything else. There will be 12 headlines created for each ad group in the ads, so more variety. For each campaign, 4 Ad Groups will be created with correct information. The regeneration will generate another campaign based on the information given in the onboarding form. All ads created are based on the information from the onboarding form. The dashboard will only have the campaign status, if there is no campaign yet, then there will be 'No campaigns yet' in the UI, and 'Create Your First Campaign →' in the UI. If there is a campaign, then the Active campaign will be shown and there will be a button that says 'View Campaign' which will take the user to the Campaigns page. When the new month comes the limit is reset automatically so the user can regenerate campaign or edit information and create a campaign and then push the campaign by connecting their Google account so that is reset automatically. 

So during the three day free trial the user can generate campaigns three times in total: 1 initial campaign is created automatically when they complete onboarding (1st generation), then they can regenerate 2 more times using the regenerate button in the Campaigns page (2nd and 3rd generation). And then they connect to Google account to push the campaign. Once the  three day free trial ends the generation button campaign and connect to Google as account is disabled until the pay and then after the pay, then they can do the regeneration like I explained before. So with regards to the three regenerations a month after the payment so either they can do it through the edit information and then It will create the campaign or they can regenerate using the regenerate campaign button but the maximum regeneration total is three times a month until the next month and then the count resets automatically.

User edits business info in settings
System auto-generates new campaign based on updated info
This counts as 1 regeneration
User sees updated campaign

Dashboard (MVP):
Campaign status only
If no campaign: "No campaigns yet" + "Create Your First Campaign →" button
If has campaign: "Active campaign" + "View Campaign" button → goes to Campaigns page.

Strict 30-character limit per headline (prevent truncation).



## What I Want to Build
[Start typing or pasting your voice-to-text here...]
 So my app is a AI generated add generator so the user assigned in completes the on boarding and from the on boarding information campaign a campaign a campaign is generated which has four other groups and the full ad groups and the campaign are based on the information given from the on bo to this app for electricians and plumbers so you could either choose to you know if you're electrician then you complete the information about electrician if you're a plumber you complete the information about being a plumber and you can even choose to be both an electrician and a plumber. Once the campaign is created the user connect the Google ad account and then they can push the campaign to the Google ads account. I want a simple MVP focus on ad quality and improve the ads ensure that it has a strength of strong. 

Based on onboarding form data - all ads created are based on the information from the onboarding form
Creates 4 ad groups with 12 varied headlines per ad group
Improves ad strength from "Poor" to "Good/Excellent"
TO Enable optimisation underdrive results the website the uses website in the ad needs to have a Google tag. There is a code in Google ads website to show how to install the Google tag.

 Google can now assemble strong combinations for different contexts. 

When there is a 30 Value in the headlines then I went to the headlines to make sense if I don't want any words to be truncated for example, I don't want London to be Londo or I dont want Birmingham to be Birming. So when the headlines are been created, I want it to make sense I went into. I want to full words so I want the AI to ensure that the words when they are in the range of 30 I want them to make sense and I want them to be suitable. I want a Thorough research on how and what causes Google acts to be disapproved because I don't want my apps to be disapproved in the on boarding I want the website you are UL to be a required field for now it's optional but I wanted to be changed to be mandatory, so the user can't skip it and it has to be a valid URL.

## Edge Cases I'm Thinking About
 The edge cases are that the headlines they have a max value of 30 in Google ads so I want the headlines and the description to make sense and I want them to to be good quality and they need to make sense and the case could be that some cities have long names like Stoke-on-Trent Birmingham for example so the truncation which happens naturally that's the cases. When I use it edits the information the campaign is automatically regenerated after they saved the information and they are done with the settings and editing the information so the campaign is automatically regenerated so that counts as one regeneration. If the regeneration fails, it does not count as a regeneration so a successful regeneration counts as a regeneration. When a user regenerates by either way through editing information or by clicking on the regenerate campaign button they can automatically regenerate the campaign but they have to wait a minute before regenerating the campaign to prevent abuse so when a user create a campaign either by through the on boarding for example when when a user signs in and they complete the on boarding a campaign is automatically created so that's a fresh campaign and when they want to regenerate, they have to wait a minute between each regeneration either by editing the information or clicking on the regenerate button this is to prevent abuse so they'll be something in the UI to tell the user to wait a minute. when the user is mid regeneration and the free trial ends the regeneration will be complete but they just cannot connect to Google that like for example the free trial ends at the exact same time the campaign is regenerating the regeneration will continue and be successful but they just cannot push it to Google ads.


## User Scenarios
When the user still has regeneration, like for example let's just say in the current month that that user is in if they did not use up all the regenerations of the month and the next month comes in,  it was still be the three regenerations so it will always be three regenerations a month, even if they did not use up all the regenerations from the previous month the account will automatically reset to 3 regardless of whether they've used the regenerations or they had some regenerations left so every month it just automatically resets to 3 if they pay, if they pay the regeneration automatically recess to 3 and if they don't pay of course that they cannot regenerate the buttons get disabled, the regeneration campaign that edit information to connect to Google ad that gets disabled the buttons and then but if they are continued continuing to pay the account automatically reset to Three. when the user complete the on boarding they obviously have to prove that they have relevant certificates and of course the ads will be we have compliance will be compliant like for example if it's an electrical trade person completing the on boarding and if they agree that they have the relevant certificates then in the ad you know will be mentioned to know part P for example.

## Potential Challenges
30-character limit enforcement
City name handling


## Questions I Have
 I don't know what will happen once the free trial ends and the user decides to not pay as in not to use the app or when the user does pay but the regeneration finishes and the regeneration button is disabled and the connect to Google ads button is disabled. I don't know what should happen. I don't know what should happen to the campaigns. Should they get paused? What should happen as I want the user to keep on using my app? When buttons are disabled (trial expired OR limit reached), the user can VIEW everything (all pages, campaigns, dashboard) but CANNOT edit settings or regenerate campaigns. User must pay to continue using (regenerating/editing). Campaigns remain visible and accessible for viewing only.

## Other Relevant Thoughts
 during the free-trial when the user uses up all the regeneration, they can still view the campaign but they just cannot regenerate or edit the information in settings until they pay so they can view everything except regenerate and edit. When a user cancel subscription commitment if they use up all the regeneration with the button will be disabled anyway but if they cancel the subscription while having regeneration counts left they can still regenerate until the end of the month. When regeneration limit is reached, user cannot edit settings page (because editing triggers auto-regeneration which counts as a regeneration). Focus on ad quality improvement (main value prop)
Keep MVP simple - dashboard just shows status. In the future, if my MVP turns out to be a success, then I want to features like estimated ROI, Qualified Leads, Ad Spend(MTD) and Cost per Lead. These Future features these are going to be something in the future so when you are going to include them don't make it a mandatory task. This is something that I want to be noted so that if in the future I want to add it will be in the suitable appropriate file.

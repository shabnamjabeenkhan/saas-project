# Brain Dump - Feature Ideas

## What I Want to Build
[Start typing or pasting your voice-to-text here...]
What I want to build is having some features that can be tracked and is updated in real time in the dashboard for example so the three main things that I want to track and have updating real time in the dashboard here is qualified Leeds or lead count so basically is a number of real customer calls from trade boost AI users add number so when a user create an ad and pushes it to the Google ads the number will be in the ad so when a customer calls that number they will be accounted as a qualified call so the rule is answered and duration which is which is greater than or equal to 30 seconds so this will filter spam missiles so this will be updated instantly via Call tracking web hook the other feature that I want to monitor real time is the ad spend of the current month of example the total money spent on Google ads so this will be good for budget control and this will be updated near real time and the other one will be the cost, so it means how much trade boost AI user is paying to get one qualified call a lead and the other optional feature is the estimated ROI so we're gonna treat every qualified to call as a paying job so every qualified call will be counted as a revenue event so it will be like it will just be a simple estimated so I'll be an estimated ROI so so they recommend a simple dashboard will be three tiles qualified calls at spend and cost per lead and then they'll be a small subtext line at the bottom which will be the estimated ROI estimated has to be stated next to ROI but the main success metric will be the cost per lead.

## Edge Cases I'm Thinking About

## User Scenarios
 I'm not sure about the user scenarios but when trade with AI users pushes a campaign, their phone number will also be in the Google Ads as a call extension.

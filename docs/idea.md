# MVP Concept Overview

## Product Vision
- Build an AI copilot that spins up profitable Google Ads campaigns for UK plumbers and electricians in minutes, removing the need for expensive agencies or DIY guesswork.
- Deliver predictable lead flow that smooths seasonal demand swings and frees tradespeople to focus on jobs instead of marketing.

## Business Model
- Subscription SaaS with two tiers aligned to company maturity (no intro discounts or add-ons in MVP):
  - **Standard (£69/month):** solo trades and micro teams that need steady inbound calls.
  - **Premium (£189/month):** established crews that manage multiple vans and want higher lead volumes plus advanced insights.
- Annual counterpart pricing (£828–£2,268) undercuts £40k+ agency retainers while keeping revenue predictable.

## Non-Negotiable MVP Features
1. **Five-Step Onboarding Wizard:** captures trade type, single primary service area (city + adjustable radius), offerings, availability, and goals so the AI understands the business context without marketing jargon.
2. **AI Campaign Generator:** produces localized ad copy, keyword themes, and starter daily budgets tuned to emergencies vs. maintenance jobs; pushes a draft Google Ads campaign directly into the user’s account via API for quick review and launch, while tracking conversions natively without external CRM integrations. Copy defaults to compliance-safe language (no Gas Safe guarantees, no instant-response promises). Seasonal playbooks remain future scope.

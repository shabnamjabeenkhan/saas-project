# TradeBoost Refund Policy

_Last updated: October 7, 2025_

## No Refunds
TradeBoost subscriptions are billed monthly in advance and are non-refundable. By subscribing, you acknowledge and agree that:
- Payments cover immediate access to AI campaign generation, performance dashboards, and related services.
- We do not offer refunds or credits for partial months, downgrades, unused time, or account inactivity.

## Cancellations
- You may cancel your subscription at any time from the billing settings in the dashboard.
- Cancellation stops future charges but does not result in a refund for the current billing cycle.

## Exceptional Circumstances
We may consider refund requests only where required by applicable consumer protection laws. Decisions are at TradeBoostâ€™s sole discretion.

## Contact
If you believe you qualify for a statutory refund or have billing questions, please reach out via the in-app support channel until a support email address is published.

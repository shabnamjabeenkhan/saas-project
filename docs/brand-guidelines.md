# Brand Identity Guidelines

## Typography
- **Primary Headline:** Space Grotesk (Google Fonts) – bold, modern, legible under tradesperson branding.
- **Secondary Headline / CTA:** Inter SemiBold – pairs cleanly with Space Grotesk.
- **Body Copy:** Inter Regular – versatile for dashboards and forms.
- **Caption/Labels:** Inter Medium all-caps for status tags.
- Hierarchy: H1 36px/44px, H2 28px/36px, Body 16px/24px, Caption 12px/16px.

## Logo Style
- Recommend **wordmark + icon**: sturdy sans-serif lettering (Space Grotesk), paired with a minimal spark/pipe icon referencing electrical/plumbing dual focus.
- Keep icon geometry simple for use in favicons and social avatars; emphasize reliability (rounded corners) and immediacy (forward-leaning angle).

## Color Palette
- **Primary:** Deep Navy #0B1F36 – conveys trust and professionalism.
- **Secondary:** Electric Blue #1E6BFF – highlights CTAs and charts.
- **Accent:** Safety Orange #FF8A2B – use sparingly for alerts, emergency messaging.
- **Neutral Light:** Mist Gray #F4F6F8 – backgrounds, cards.
- **Neutral Dark:** Slate #2C3A4A – text and icons.
- Ensure accessible contrast: pair Electric Blue with white text, use Slate for body copy on light backgrounds.

## Imagery & Tone
- Favor photography showing real tradespeople on-site; avoid overly polished stock.
- Use iconography to communicate speed (lightning), reliability (shield), locality (map pin).
- Tone: direct, action-oriented, friendly without fluff (“Launch campaigns in minutes”).

## Application Notes
- Maintain consistent padding and spacing (8px/16px base grid).
- Buttons: rounded 10px radius, filled primary for main actions; outline variant for secondary.
- Charts: use navy/blue gradients with orange for conversion highlights.
- Accessibility: ensure alternative text on icons, maintain focus states following color palette.

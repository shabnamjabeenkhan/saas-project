Data is your startup's compass. Without analytics, you're flying blind - guessing what features to build, which marketing channels work, and why customers churn. This guide shows you how to set up comprehensive analytics from day one.

## Analytics Fundamentals

### Why Analytics Matter

**Without analytics:**
❌ Build features nobody wants
❌ Waste marketing budget
❌ Don't know why users leave
❌ Can't measure product success

**With analytics:**
✅ Understand user behavior
✅ Optimize conversion funnels
✅ Identify growth opportunities
✅ Make data-driven decisions

### Analytics Hierarchy

**1. Business Metrics (What matters to your company)**
- Revenue, growth rate, customer acquisition cost
- Monthly active users, retention rates
- Customer lifetime value, churn rate

**2. Product Metrics (How users interact with your product)**
- Feature usage, user flows, engagement
- Conversion rates, funnel drop-offs
- Performance metrics, error rates

**3. Technical Metrics (System health)**
- Page load times, uptime, error rates
- API response times, database performance
- Infrastructure costs, scaling metrics

## Setting Up Analytics

### 1. Website Analytics

**Google Analytics 4 (Free, Recommended)**
```javascript
// Add to your HTML head
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

**Privacy-compliant alternatives:**
- **Plausible:** Privacy-first, GDPR compliant
- **Fathom:** Lightweight, privacy-focused
- **Simple Analytics:** No cookies, transparent pricing

### 2. Product Analytics

**PostHog (Recommended for Kaizen)**
- **Event tracking:** User actions and feature usage
- **Funnel analysis:** Conversion flow optimization
- **A/B testing:** Feature experimentation
- **User segmentation:** Behavioral cohorts

**Setup:**
```javascript
// Install PostHog
npm install posthog-js

// Initialize in your app
import posthog from 'posthog-js'
posthog.init('your-project-api-key', { api_host: 'https://app.posthog.com' })

// Track events
posthog.capture('user_signed_up', { plan: 'pro' })
```

### 3. Business Intelligence

gtag('event', 'sign_up', {
  method: 'email',
  value: 1
});

gtag('event', 'feature_used', {
  feature_name: 'export_pdf',
  user_type: 'premium'
});
```

### 2. Funnel Analysis

**Identify drop-off points:**
- Sign-up flow completion
- Onboarding sequence
- Feature adoption paths
- Upgrade conversion funnels

**Optimization opportunities:**
- Simplify complex steps
- Add progress indicators
- Provide help at friction points
- A/B test improvements

### 3. Attribution Tracking

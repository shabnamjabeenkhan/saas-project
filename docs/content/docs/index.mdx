Welcome to the **Startup Accelerator** documentation - your comprehensive guide to building, launching, and scaling a successful startup.

## What is This Accelerator?

This accelerator provides everything you need to go from idea to production-ready startup:

- **Technical Stack**: Battle-tested tools and frameworks for rapid development
- **Architecture Guidance**: Proven patterns for scalable applications  
- **Cost Optimization**: Build profitably from day one with 80%+ margins
- **Best Practices**: Lessons learned from successful startups
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: From setup to deployment and beyond

## Who is This Accelerator For?

This accelerator is designed for **developers with a solid foundation in software engineering**:

✅ You've completed the Frontend section of the Software Engineer Roadmap  
✅ You understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React fundamentals  
✅ You have backend systems knowledge (databases, APIs, authentication)  
✅ You're ready to build and ship a real product  

**Not for absolute beginners** - You should have prior coding experience and understand software engineering concepts.

## Before You Start Building

### 1. Register Your Business Entity (Optional)

<Note>
Only required if you plan to accept payments from customers
</Note>

- **Register a parent company** in your country for legal protection
- **Consider tax optimization**: Panama entities offer 0% tax for international businesses
- **Consult a lawyer**: Get professional advice for your specific situation

### 2. Validate Your Idea

<Warning>
Don't skip validation! Building without validation wastes time and money.
</Warning>

Use the [Founder Blueprint Idea Validation Node](https://founder.codeandcreed.tech/) to:
- Test your assumptions
- Interview potential customers
- Validate market demand
- Define your MVP scope

See our [Idea Validation Guide](/building-with-kaizen/idea-validation) for step-by-step instructions.

### 3. Join the Community

Connect with other builders in the [AI MVP Builders Skool Community](https://www.skool.com/ai-mvp-builders/about) for:
- Live workshops and Q&A sessions
- Peer feedback and support
- Networking with other founders
- Access to exclusive resources

## Our Philosophy

We believe in:

1. **Speed to Market**: Get your MVP live in days, not months
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Maintain high profit margins even at scale (10,000+ DAUs at ~$200-300/month)
3. **Modern Stack**: Use the best tools without unnecessary complexity
4. **Focus on Product**: Let infrastructure handle itself so you can build features

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with this accelerator, ensure you have:

1. **Frontend Knowledge** - Complete the Frontend section of the Software Engineer Roadmap (HTML, CSS, JS, and React fundamentals)
2. **Backend Systems Knowledge** - Complete the [Systems Expert Fundamentals Course](https://www.algoexpert.io/systems/fundamentals)
3. **Business Fundamentals** - Understanding of SaaS business models, customer acquisition, and product-market fit

## Your Startup Journey

### Step 1: Setup Your Tech Stack

Follow our comprehensive setup guide:

1. **[Prerequisites](/setup/1-prerequisites)** - Required knowledge and API keys
2. **[Project Setup](/setup/2-project-setup)** - Clone and install dependencies
3. **[Basic Configuration](/setup/3-basic-configuration)** - Verify static functionality
4. **[Authentication Setup](/setup/4-authentication-setup)** - Enable Clerk + Convex
5. **[Payments Setup](/setup/5-payments-setup)** - Configure Polar.sh billing
6. **[Email Setup](/setup/6-email-setup)** - Add Resend transactional emails
7. **[AI Setup](/setup/7-ai-setup)** - Enable OpenAI chat functionality
8. **[Production Deployment](/setup/8-production-deployment)** - Deploy to Railway
9. **[Development Workflow](/setup/9-development-workflow)** - Maintain and extend your app

### Step 2: Understand Your Architecture

Learn about the technical decisions, costs, and architecture:

- **[Architecture](/project-documentation/architecture)** - System design and component interactions
- **[Cost Estimation](/project-documentation/cost-estimation)** - Projected costs at different scales
- **[Database Schema](/project-documentation/database-schema)** - Data models and relationships
- **[User Flows](/project-documentation/user-flows)** - User journeys and interaction patterns

### Step 3: Build and Ship

- **[Rapid UI Prototyping](/building-with-kaizen/rapid-ui-prototyping)** - Build beautiful interfaces fast
- **[Database Migrations](/building-with-kaizen/database-migrations)** - Manage schema changes safely
- **[Observability](/building-with-kaizen/observability)** - Monitor errors and uptime

## Why This Approach Works

Traditional startup development involves:
- ❌ Months of infrastructure setup
- ❌ Complex DevOps configuration
- ❌ High operational costs
- ❌ Slow iteration cycles

Our accelerator approach:
- ✅ Production-ready in days
- ✅ Zero infrastructure management
- ✅ Pay only for what you use
- ✅ Ship features daily

## Cost Structure

All services have **generous free tiers**.

Even as your startup grows, costs remain minimal:
- **10,000+ DAUs**: ~$200-300/month
- **Profit Margin**: 80%+
- **Scaling**: Automatic with zero configuration

These third-party services abstract away significant infrastructure work, letting you focus solely on building your product and acquiring customers.

## Next Steps

Ready to build your startup? Start with:

## Overview

This session teaches you how to start every project with a discovery phase and use a simple 8-question checklist to frame complex problems in ways that make useful solutions inevitable.

## Learning Objectives

### Discovery Phase & Problem Framing
- Start every project with a structured discovery phase
- Use an 8-question checklist to frame complex problems
- Make useful solutions inevitable through proper problem framing

### The First Rule of Machine Learning
- Understand the first rule of machine learning
- Use simple rules to build prototypes
- Validate assumptions and gather feedback early

### Data Collection & Quality
- Determine the value of collecting additional data
- Understand what a good dataset looks like
- Identify when you need more data vs. better features

### Data Transformation
Convert data into numerical vectors using:
- **Label Encoding**: Converting categorical labels to numbers
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Creating binary columns for categories
- **Target Encoding**: Encoding based on target variable statistics
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into meaningful pieces

### Feature Engineering
- Engineer predictive features from raw data
- Implement strategies for handling missing values
- Create derived features that improve model performance

### Labeling Strategy & Active Learning
- Design an effective labeling strategy
- Use **Active Learning** to automate labeling at scale
- Implement **uncertainty sampling** to identify ambiguous cases
- Apply **diversity sampling** to ensure representative coverage

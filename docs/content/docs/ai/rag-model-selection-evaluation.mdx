## Overview

Learn how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, implement robust evaluation protocols, and make informed model-selection decisions.

## Learning Objectives

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Build RAG systems to enhance language models
- Integrate external, up-to-date knowledge sources
- Understand when RAG is the right solution

### Retrieval Strategies
Compare and implement different retrieval approaches:
- **Term-based retrieval**: Traditional keyword matching
- **Embedding-based semantic retrieval**: Vector similarity search
- Understand tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and complexity

### Model Selection
Develop strategies for choosing the right model:
- Weigh **performance** vs. **latency** vs. **cost**
- Understand when to use larger vs. smaller models
- Consider open-source vs. proprietary solutions

### Evaluation Protocol
Implement a robust evaluation framework:
- Establish a **strong baseline** before optimization
- Use **holdout sets** to prevent overfitting
- Apply **cross-validation** for reliable performance estimates
- Master **prompt engineering** techniques
- Create effective **scoring rubrics** for subjective tasks

### Reproducibility & Versioning
- Implement **model versioning** to track experiments
- Use **tracing** to debug and optimize
- Keep experiments and data reproducible

### Model-Centric vs. Data-Centric AI
- Understand the difference between improving models vs. improving data
- Know when to focus on each approach
- Build iterative improvement cycles

# Learn AI Engineering

A comprehensive 6-session curriculum that takes you from foundational concepts to production-ready AI systems. Learn how to build, deploy, and maintain reliable AI applications that users can trust.

## What You'll Learn

This curriculum covers the complete lifecycle of AI engineering:

- **Problem Framing & Data**: Start projects with proper discovery, engineer features, and automate labeling
- **Model Development**: Build RAG systems, select models, and establish evaluation protocols
- **Trust & Safety**: Implement guardrails, perform error analysis, and ensure data quality
- **Production Deployment**: Deploy models efficiently with optimization and caching strategies
- **Monitoring & Maintenance**: Detect drift, implement observability, and test in production
- **Advanced Systems**: Build continual learning pipelines and agentic systems

## Who This Is For

This curriculum is designed for:

- **Software Engineers** transitioning to AI engineering
- **ML Engineers** looking to bridge the gap between research and production
- **Product Engineers** building AI-powered features
- **Founders** building AI startups and need practical, production-ready knowledge

## Learning Path

Each session builds on the previous ones:

1. **Start with Discovery** - Learn how to frame problems correctly
2. **Build Systems** - Create RAG systems and establish evaluation
3. **Ensure Trust** - Implement safety measures and quality checks
4. **Deploy Efficiently** - Optimize for production workloads
5. **Monitor Continuously** - Detect issues and test in production
6. **Scale & Automate** - Build systems that learn and improve over time

<Note>
**Coming Soon**: Detailed content, code examples, and hands-on exercises for each session are being added progressively.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Understanding of REST APIs and web services
- Familiarity with databases and data structures
- Basic statistics and linear algebra (helpful but not required)

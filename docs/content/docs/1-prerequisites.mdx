## Tech Stack Overview

Kaizen uses a modern, production-ready stack:

- **React Router v7** - Full-stack React framework with SSR
- **Convex** - Real-time database and serverless functions
- **Clerk** - Authentication as a Service
- **Polar.sh** - Subscription billing and payments
- **Resend** - Email as a Service
- **OpenAI** - AI chat capabilities (optional)
- **Railway (or Self-Hosting)** - Deployment platform

## Cost Considerations

All services offer generous free tiers. Expected costs for a growing app (10,000+ DAUs):
- **Total**: $200-300/month with 80%+ profit margin
- Services abstract infrastructure complexity while maintaining cost efficiency

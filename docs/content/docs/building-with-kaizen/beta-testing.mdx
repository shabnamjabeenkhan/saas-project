# Beta Testing & Launch

Learn when your MVP is ready to launch and how to collect feedback from beta testers efficiently.

## Don't Ship Too Fast

<Warning>
**Shipping too early can hurt your reputation and waste your beta testers' goodwill.**
</Warning>

### How to Know Your MVP is Ready

Read: **[Denis Jeliazkov's Thread on MVP Readiness](https://x.com/DenisJeliazkov/status/1969099171455254824)**

**Checklist before launching:**
- [ ] Core feature works end-to-end
- [ ] Authentication is stable
- [ ] Payments process successfully (if applicable)
- [ ] No critical bugs in happy path
- [ ] Onboarding flow is clear
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Error messages are helpful
- [ ] Loading states implemented
- [ ] Email notifications work
- [ ] You've dogfooded it yourself for 1 week

<Note>
**Rule of thumb**: If you wouldn't pay for it in its current state, it's not ready.
</Note>

## Beta Testing Strategy

### Finding Beta Testers

**Where to find testers:**
1. **Your waitlist** - Email them first
2. **Product Hunt Ship** - Build in public
3. **Reddit** (relevant subreddits)
4. **Twitter** - Thread asking for testers
5. **Indie Hackers** community
6. **Friends/colleagues** (but get honest feedback)

**How many testers:**
- **Start with 10-20** close testers
- Get feedback and iterate
- Expand to 50-100 wider beta
- Then public launch

### Beta Tester Onboarding

**Email Template:**
```
Subject: You're in! Early access to [Product Name]

Hey [Name],

Thanks for signing up for early access! 🎉

You can access the beta here: [link]

What we're looking for:
- Try to [core action] at least once
- Report any bugs you find (use the bug report button)
- Tell us what's confusing or missing

We'll be shipping updates daily based on your feedback.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

- [Your name]
```

### Collecting Feedback

**Use a feedback widget:**
```typescript
// Example: Canny or UserJot integration
<FeedbackWidget 
  projectId="your-project-id"
  user={{
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name,
  }}
/>
```

**Quick feedback prompts:**
- "What's the ONE thing we should improve?"
- "What almost stopped you from signing up?"
- "What feature is missing that you expected?"

## Fixing Reported Bugs Quickly

### Triage System

**Priority Levels:**
1. **P0 - Critical**: Blocks core functionality → Fix immediately
2. **P1 - High**: Impacts many users → Fix within 24h

**Example P0 bugs:**

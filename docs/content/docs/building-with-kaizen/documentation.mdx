# Documentation is King

<Note>
**Keep your documentation up to date = [Joggr.ai](https://www.joggr.ai/)**

Automated documentation updates save time and prevent drift.
</Note>

## Why Documentation Matters

**Without docs:**
- ❌ Lose context between sessions
- ❌ Repeat the same mistakes
- ❌ Confuse AI assistants with missing context
- ❌ Struggle to onboard team members
- ❌ Forget why you made decisions

**With good docs:**
- ✅ Clear execution roadmap
- ✅ Better AI assistance (context!)
- ✅ Faster onboarding
- ✅ Decision history
- ✅ Reduced bugs and rework

## What are Markdown Files?

**Markdown** (`.md` or `.mdx` files) is a lightweight markup language for formatting text.

Markdown lets you write formatted documents using plain text. It's the standard for technical documentation, README files, and developer notes.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2

**Bold text** and *italic text*

- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2

[Link text](https://example.com)

\`\`\`javascript
const code = "syntax highlighting";
\`\`\`
```

## Essential Documentation Files

### Create a `docs/` Folder

These are the **main files** you want in a `docs/` folder for clear execution:

```
docs/
├── README.md                 # Project overview
├── idea.md                   # Problem, solution, target customer
├── architecture.md           # System design and tech decisions
├── user-flows.md             # User journeys and workflows
├── database-schema.md        # Data models and relationships
├── cost-estimation.md        # Projected costs at scale
├── features.md               # Feature roadmap and priorities
├── api-reference.md          # API endpoints (if applicable)
└── learnings.md              # What you learned while building
```

## Building Docs with AI

### Method 1: Conversation-Driven Documentation

**Steps:**
1. Open your AI assistant
2. Have a conversation about your project
3. Ask AI to structure it into markdown
4. Copy into docs file

**Example Prompt:**
```
I'm building a time tracking app for freelancers. 
Let me explain the problem, solution, and target customer...

[Explain for 5-10 minutes]

Now, take everything I just said and structure it into 
a professional idea.md file using markdown.
```

### Method 2: Template + Fill

**Steps:**
1. Ask AI for a documentation template
2. Fill in your specific details
3. Expand sections as needed

**Example Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive architecture.md template for a SaaS app
using React Router v7, Convex, Clerk, and Polar.sh. 

Include sections for:
- System overview
- Tech stack rationale  
- Data flow
- Security
- Third-party integrations
```

### Method 3: Extract from Codebase

**Steps:**
1. Point AI to your codebase
2. Ask it to generate documentation
3. Review and refine

**Example Prompt:**
```
Review my Convex schema in @convex/schema.ts and 
generate a database-schema.md file that documents:
- All tables
- Field types
- Relationships
- Indexes
```

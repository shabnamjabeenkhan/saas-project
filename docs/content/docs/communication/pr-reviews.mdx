Great code reviews are the foundation of maintainable software and healthy engineering teams. 

It's where knowledge is shared, bugs are caught, and code is improved.

Poor PRs create frustration, delay deployments, and erode team trust. Learn how to write PRs that engineers love reviewing.

## Why PR Reviews Matter

### For Individual Growth
- **Knowledge sharing:** Learn from others' approaches
- **Quality improvement:** Catch bugs and design issues early
- **Skill development:** Exposure to different coding styles and techniques

### For Team Health
- **Consistency:** Maintain code quality standards
- **Collaboration:** Build shared understanding of the codebase
- **Trust:** Ensure changes are thoroughly vetted

### For Business Success
- **Reliability:** Fewer bugs in production
- **Velocity:** Faster, more confident deployments
- **Scalability:** Code that can be maintained as the team grows

## Writing Great PRs

### 1. Start with a Clear Description

**Bad PR description:**
```
Fix bug
```

**Good PR description:**
```
Fix user authentication timeout issue

## Problem
Users were being logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity, but the session timeout was set to 2 hours. This caused confusion and support tickets.

## Solution
Updated session timeout configuration from 30 minutes to 2 hours to match user expectations.

## Testing
- Verified login sessions persist for 2+ hours
- Confirmed logout still works when explicitly clicked
- No impact on existing user sessions

## Screenshots
[Before/After screenshots of session behavior]

Fixes #123
```

**What makes a great description:**
- **Context:** Why is this change needed?
- **Solution:** What did you change and why?
- **Testing:** How did you verify it works?
- **Impact:** What might break or be affected?
- **Visuals:** Screenshots, videos, or diagrams when helpful

### 2. Keep PRs Small and Focused

**Anti-patterns:**
❌ 500+ line PRs with multiple features
❌ Mixing refactoring with new features
❌ Including unrelated formatting changes

**Best practices:**
✅ Single responsibility per PR
✅ Under 200-300 lines when possible
✅ Related changes bundled together
✅ Breaking changes isolated

### 3. Write Self-Documenting Code

**Before review:**
- Run your own tests
- Check for linting errors
- Review your own code first
- Add comments for complex logic

**Code quality checklist:**
- [ ] No console.logs or debugging code
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No linting errors

## The Review Process

### For Authors: Preparing for Review

**1. Self-review first:**
- Read through your code like a reviewer would
- Check for obvious bugs or issues
- Ensure code follows team conventions

**2. Test thoroughly:**
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests for API changes
- Manual testing of user-facing features
- Edge cases and error conditions

**3. Provide context:**
- Link to relevant tickets/issues
- Mention related PRs or discussions
- Explain design decisions if they're not obvious

### For Reviewers: Effective Reviewing

**1. Review mindset:**
- Assume positive intent
- Focus on improvement, not criticism
- Ask questions when unclear
- Suggest alternatives when appropriate

**2. Review systematically:**
- **Functionality:** Does it work as described?
- **Code quality:** Is it readable and maintainable?
- **Testing:** Are edge cases covered?
- **Performance:** Any obvious bottlenecks?
- **Security:** Any vulnerabilities introduced?

**3. Provide actionable feedback:**
❌ "This is bad"
✅ "Consider using early return here to reduce nesting"

## Common PR Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Vague Requirements

**Problem:** PR description doesn't explain why the change is needed.

**Solution:**
- Always include business context
- Link to user stories or tickets
- Explain the problem being solved

### Issue: Large, Unfocused PRs

**Problem:** Too many changes to review effectively.

**Solution:**
- Break into smaller PRs
- Use feature flags for incremental rollout
- Separate refactoring from feature work

### Issue: Poor Testing

**Problem:** Changes break existing functionality.

**Solution:**
- Run full test suite before submitting
- Add tests for new functionality
- Consider integration tests for complex features

### Issue: No Documentation Updates

**Problem:** Code changes without corresponding docs.

**Solution:**
- Update READMEs for API changes
- Add code comments for complex logic
- Update user-facing documentation

## Review Feedback Guidelines

### Giving Feedback

**Be specific and actionable:**
❌ "This function is too long"
✅ "Consider breaking this function into smaller functions - the authentication logic could be extracted into `validateCredentials()`"

**Use "I" statements:**
❌ "You didn't handle this edge case"
✅ "I'm concerned about this edge case - what happens if the user passes null?"

**Offer solutions:**
❌ "This is inefficient"
✅ "This loop could be optimized using a Map for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) array searches"

### Receiving Feedback

**Don't take it personally:**
- Feedback is about the code, not you
- Experienced developers still get feedback
- Use it as a learning opportunity

**Respond constructively:**
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Ask clarifying questions
- Explain your reasoning when challenged
- Be willing to make changes

**Know when to push back:**
- Have data to support your approach
- Explain trade-offs clearly
- Suggest alternatives if you disagree

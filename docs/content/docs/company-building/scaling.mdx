## Infrastructure

If your product starts to get a lot of traffic then you may need to scale your infrastructure...

Our current deployment platform (Vercel) has been great for us so far, but bills can get expensive when we scale.

The next step is to move to your own infrastructure.

<Note>
  Don't even think about this until you have a serious amount of traffic.
</Note>

### Self-Hosting Options

If you want to scale while maintaining cost efficiency, self-hosting is the way to go.

What does that mean?

- You deploy your own web server, database server, configure your own SSL certificates, application proxy, etc.
- You'll be responsible for the hardware and infrastructure.
- You'll be responsible for the maintenance and updates.
- You'll be responsible for the security.

Fear not, we know some foolproof ways to do this:

1. **Bare Metal VPS Setup ($200/month)**
   - Using providers like Hetzner, you can get:
     - 80 dedicated cores
     - 128GB RAM
     - 2TB NVMe SSD
     - Capable of handling up to 1M monthly active users
   - [Detailed guide on Hetzner self-hosting setup](https://grski.pl/self-host)

2. **Global Bare Metal Servers**
   - [Latitude.sh](https://www.latitude.sh/) - Enterprise-grade infrastructure with:
     - 23 global edge locations across 5 continents
     - API, CLI, and SDKs for automation
     - Terraform provider for Infrastructure as Code
     - DDoS protection included
     - Ideal for AI/ML workloads and high-performance computing

3. **Containerized Deployment Options**

     - Real-time subscriptions
     - Auto-generated APIs
     - Dashboard interface

### Docker Log Management
To prevent Docker logs from consuming excessive disk space, configure log rotation limits:

1. Create/edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:
```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "20m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

2. Restart Docker daemon:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

3. Recreate containers to apply new config:
```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

<Note>
The "local" log driver is optimized for disk usage and performance with automatic size limits and rotation, preventing logs from consuming your entire disk space.

## Team Scaling & Recruitment

### AI-Powered Recruitment Tools

As your company grows, finding the right talent becomes critical. Modern AI tools can significantly accelerate the hiring process:

- [Juicebox (PeopleGPT)](https://juicebox.ai/) - AI recruitment search engine:
  - Search 800M+ candidate profiles using natural language
  - No Boolean search required - just describe what you need
  - Real-time analysis of profiles, websites, and publications
  - Instant access to contact details and email integration
  - Personalized AI email templates for outreach at scale
  - Parse job descriptions to auto-configure search queries

### Recruitment Best Practices
- **Define Clear Requirements**: Use specific prompts to get precise candidate matches
- **Personalized Outreach**: Leverage AI-generated templates while maintaining authentic communication
- **Multi-Channel Approach**: Combine AI tools with traditional networking and referrals
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on building relationships with top candidates rather than mass outreach

### Professional Support Services

If you need additional expertise:
- [CTO-as-a-Service](https://cto-as-a-service.io/) - Technical leadership and guidance
- [CFO-as-a-Service](https://www.cfo-as-a-service.be/) - Financial planning and management

<Note>
Self-hosting can offer significant cost savings compared to cloud services, but requires more hands-on management and infrastructure knowledge.
